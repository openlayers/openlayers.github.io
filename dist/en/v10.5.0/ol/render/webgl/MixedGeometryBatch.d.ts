/**
 * @classdesc This class is used to group several geometries of various types together for faster rendering.
 * Three inner batches are maintained for polygons, lines and points. Each time a feature is added, changed or removed
 * from the batch, these inner batches are modified accordingly in order to keep them up-to-date.
 *
 * A feature can be present in several inner batches, for example a polygon geometry will be present in the polygon batch
 * and its linear rings will be present in the line batch. Multi geometries are also broken down into individual geometries
 * and added to the corresponding batches in a recursive manner.
 *
 * Corresponding {@link module:ol/render/webgl/BatchRenderer} instances are then used to generate the render instructions
 * and WebGL buffers (vertices and indices) for each inner batches; render instructions are stored on the inner batches,
 * alongside the transform used to convert world coords to screen coords at the time these instructions were generated.
 * The resulting WebGL buffers are stored on the batches as well.
 *
 * An important aspect of geometry batches is that there is no guarantee that render instructions and WebGL buffers
 * are synchronized, i.e. render instructions can describe a new state while WebGL buffers might not have been written yet.
 * This is why two world-to-screen transforms are stored on each batch: one for the render instructions and one for
 * the WebGL buffers.
