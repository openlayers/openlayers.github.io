<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>OpenLayers is a modular, high-performance, feature-packed library for displaying and interacting with maps and geospatial data.</p>
<p>The library comes with built-in support for a wide range of commercial and free image and vector tile sources, and the most popular open and proprietary vector data formats. With OpenLayers&#39;s map projection support, data can be in any projection.</p>
<h2 id="public-api">Public API</h2>
<p>OpenLayers is available as <a href="https://npmjs.com/package/ol"><code>ol</code> npm package</a>, which provides all modules of the officially supported <a href="../../apidoc">API</a>.</p>
<h2 id="browser-support">Browser Support</h2>
<p>OpenLayers runs on all modern browsers (with greater than 1% global usage).  This includes Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge. For older browsers, polyfills (<a href="https://polyfill-fastly.io">Fastly</a> or <a href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill">Cloudflare</a>) will likely need to be added.</p>
<p>The library is intended for use on both desktop/laptop and mobile devices, and supports pointer and touch interactions.</p>
<h2 id="module-and-naming-conventions">Module and Naming Conventions</h2>
<p>OpenLayers modules with CamelCase names provide classes as default exports, and may contain additional constants or functions as named exports:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import Map from &#39;ol/Map.js&#39;;
import View from &#39;ol/View.js&#39;;
</code></pre>
<p>Class hierarchies grouped by their parent are provided in a subfolder of the package, e.g. <code>layer/</code>.</p>
<p>For convenience, these are also available as named exports, e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import {Map, View} from &#39;ol&#39;;
import {Tile, Vector} from &#39;ol/layer.js&#39;;
</code></pre>
<p>In addition to these re-exported classes, modules with lowercase names also provide constants or functions as named exports:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import {getUid} from &#39;ol&#39;;
import {fromLonLat} from &#39;ol/proj.js&#39;;
</code></pre>
